# Music-Recommendation-Based-on-Facial-Expression-Spotify-API-Python
A facial expression-based music recommender captures emotions via webcam using a pre-trained model like FER-2013. Each emotion is mapped to a Spotify playlist using Spotipy for authentication and playback. When the userâ€™s mood changes, the system updates the music accordingly, creating a personalized, emotion-driven experience.
